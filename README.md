# Friday Challenge
#What was the challenge?
To create a script in order to carry out commands and push it to Git Repository
# How I expected the challenge to go?
The challenge was good and exciting and it went well i believe
# What went well?
Pushing it to git repository 
# What didn't go as planned?
I believe I had issues with the premissions 
# Possible improvements for future challenges
To have examples in all modules and make comprehensive notes with examples. In addition to obtain the recorded session after the lesson. Also I believe we should have spent more time on writing scripts as that was the core of the challenge althought we spent one day on it.
